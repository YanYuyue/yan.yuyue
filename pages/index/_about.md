# About Me

My name is Yuyue. I received the M.E. degree and the Ph.D. degree in Systems and Control Engineering from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2019 and 2022, respectively. I was a Research Fellow with the Department of Systems and Control Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, in 2023, and then joined the Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 2024, where I am currently a Specially Appointed Research Fellow. My research interests include game theory, stability of nonlinear dynamical systems, hybrid systems, and noncooperative systems; and applications to multiagent systems, transportation systems, financial dynamics, and economic/social system.
